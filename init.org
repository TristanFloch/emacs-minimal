#+title: Minimal Emacs configuration

#+PROPERTY: header-args :results silent :tangle "./init.el"
#+STARTUP: overview

This is a minimal Emacs configuration.
Its goal is to provide a sane basis for anyone who might want to create their own configuration.

This is greatly inspired by [[https://github.com/Yumasi/simple-emacs-config][Yumasi's configuration for EPITA students]].

One can copy this org file and tangle it with =org-babel-tangle= or simply copy code blocks to their configuration.

* Package management
** Package archives

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")))
#+end_src

** Package manager

Multiple package managers exist. Here I go with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] as it is pretty straightforward.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package-initialize)
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
(require 'use-package)
(setq use-package-always-ensure t) ; auto enable packages from config file
#+end_src

[[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][Straight]] is another great package manager that one might want to look into.
